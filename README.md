# dotfiles
All dotfiles that need to be tracked.

This particular version uses `GNU Stow`

0. Install `GNU Stow`
1. Clone this repo to a place where you want your config files, e.g., at the moment of writing I like `~/src/dotfiles`.
2. Call `stow */` to create all the links to all the configs or call `stow [config I want to restore]` to restore just one.
